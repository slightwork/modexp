# modexp
Modular Exponentiation Calculator: Finds solutions to modular exponentiation problems of the form: 
x ≡ (a ^ k) mod n using the fast modular exponentiation method and showing all the steps taken to obtain the answer. 

###Main Files in this software package:
* log.txt - A log of the program which shows how to compile the program, run the program, and sample operation and solutions to problems.
* Makefile - for compiling and removing the binary.
* readme.txt (this file)
* modexp.c - C source code of a program to solve modular exponentiation problems.

###Notes: 
* This program was designed to work on Linux or UNIX environments ONLY. 
* This program assummes the user knows or has studied the fundamentals of modular arithmetic.
* This program attempts to curb invalid input to some extent, but the user should not try to "break" the program and instead use it for productive calculation.
* Implemented using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32-bit, on an Intel® Core™ i5-2520M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 machine, but also compatible with 64-bit Operating Systems of the same relation.
